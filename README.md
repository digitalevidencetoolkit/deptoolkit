# Digital Evidence Toolkit QLDB API

# Install and development
```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

This will start a REST API on port 3000 which includes the logic for interacting with the ledger, as well as a single-page web app on port 5000 which consumes data from the API and represents it visually.

## Usage
Deliver data to the ledger with the [Digital Evidence Toolkit Firefox extension](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/firefox-extension).
