_(Or **DEPToolkit** for short. Bit of a mouthful otherwise)_

A proof-of-concept software for researchers and small teams sifting through online material. With only one click of the mouse, the material will be **archived in a framework demonstrating chain of custody and stored durably**. Once included in the growing database, users will be able to go back to search through and **annotate the material**, and to **export working copies** of said material for publication and dissemination.

A database built thusly can be handed to a prosecutor ten years down the line, and they will be able to say with mathematical certainty: “the material in this archive is identical and contemporary to the one saved at the time, ten years ago.”

Built with the support of **Prototype Fund**, the **German Federal Ministry for Education and Research**, the **Open Knowledge Foundation**, and **Amazon Web Services**.

### Architecture

The Docker Compose orchestration is composed of several services:

- An Express/TypeScript API,
- A plain JS browser extension
- And a frontend

To start the whole app:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```
